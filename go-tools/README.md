# Go Tools

This is a set of cli tools that I find useful for me. It helps me get things done more easily than I otherwise would
be able to.

## Tools

- Epub Linter is a tool that can be used to format an epub file
- Git Helper is a tool that can be used to simplify some git commands or actions that I normally forget
