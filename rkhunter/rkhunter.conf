#
# This is the main configuration file for Rootkit Hunter.
#
# You can modify this file directly, or you can create a local configuration
# file. The local file must be named 'rkhunter.conf.local', and must reside
# in the same directory as this file. Alternatively you can create a directory,
# named 'rkhunter.d', which also must be in the same directory as this
# configuration file. Within the 'rkhunter.d' directory you can place further
# configuration files. There is no restriction on the file names used, other
# than they must end in '.conf'.
#
# Please modify the configuration file(s) to your own requirements. It is
# recommended that the command 'rkhunter -C' is run after any changes have
# been made.
#
# Please review the documentation before posting bug reports or questions.
# To report bugs, provide patches or comments, please go to:
# http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net
#
# To ask questions about rkhunter, please use the 'rkhunter-users' mailing list.
# Note that this is a moderated list, so please subscribe before posting.
#
# In the configuration files, lines beginning with a hash (#), and blank lines,
# are ignored. Also, end-of-line comments are not supported.
#
# Any of the configuration options may appear more than once. However, several
# options only take one value, and so the last one seen will be used. Some
# options are allowed to appear more than once, and the text describing the
# option will say if this is so. These configuration options will, in effect,
# have their values concatenated together. To delete a previously specified
# option list, specify the option with no value (that is, a null string).
#
# Some of the options are space-separated lists, others, typically those
# specifying pathnames, are newline-separated lists. These must be entered
# as one item per line. Quotes must not be used to surround the pathname.
#
# For example, to specify two pathnames, '/tmp/abc' and '/tmp/xyz', for an
# option:         XXX=/tmp/abc                (correct)
#                 XXX=/tmp/xyz
#
#                 XXX="/tmp/abc"              (incorrect)
#                 XXX="/tmp/xyz"
#
#                 XXX=/tmp/abc  /tmp/xyz      (incorrect)
#    or           XXX="/tmp/abc  /tmp/xyz"    (incorrect)
#    or           XXX="/tmp/abc"  "/tmp/xyz"  (incorrect)
#
# The last three examples are being configured as space-separated lists,
# which is incorrect, generally, for options specifying pathnames. They
# should be configured with one entry per line as in the first example.
#
# If wildcard characters (globbing) are allowed for an option, then the
# text describing the option will say so. Any globbing character explicitly
# required in a pathname should be escaped.
#
# Space-separated lists may be enclosed by quotes, although they are not
# required. If they are used, then they must only appear at the start and
# end of the list, not in the middle.
#
# For example:    XXX=abc  def  gh            (correct)
#                 XXX="abc  def  gh"          (correct)
#                 XXX="abc"  "def"  "gh"      (incorrect)
#
# Space-separated lists may also be entered simply as one entry per line.
#
# For example:    XXX=abc                     (correct)
#                 XXX=def
#                 XXX="gh"
#
# If a configuration option is never set, then the program will assume a
# default value. The text describing the option will state the default value.
# If there is no default, then rkhunter will calculate a value or pathname
# to use. If a value is set for a configuration option, then the default
# value is ignored. If it is wished to keep the default value, as well as
# any other set value, then the default must be explicitly set.
#

#
# If this option is set to '1', it specifies that when the '--update' option is
# used, then the mirrors file is to be checked for updates as well. If the
# current mirrors file contains any local mirrors, these will be prepended to
# the updated file. If this option is set to '0', the mirrors file can only be
# updated manually. This may be useful if only using local mirrors.
#
# The default value is '1'.
#
UPDATE_MIRRORS=0

#
# The MIRRORS_MODE option tells rkhunter which mirrors are to be used when
# the '--update' or '--versioncheck' command-line options are given.
# Possible values are:
#     0 - use any mirror
#     1 - only use local mirrors
#     2 - only use remote mirrors
#
# Local and remote mirrors can be defined in the mirrors file by using the
# 'local=' and 'remote=' keywords respectively.
#
# The default value is '0'.
#
MIRRORS_MODE=1

#
# This option specifies the directory to use for temporary files.
#
# NOTE: Do not use '/tmp' as your temporary directory. Some important files
# will be written to this directory, so be sure that the directory permissions
# are secure.
#
# The installer program will set the default directory. If this default is
# subsequently commented out or removed, then the program will assume a
# default directory beneath the installation directory.
#
TMPDIR=/var/lib/rkhunter/tmp

#
# This option specifies the database directory to use.
#
# The installer program will set the default directory. If this default is
# subsequently commented out or removed, then the program will assume a
# default directory beneath the installation directory.
#
DBDIR=/var/lib/rkhunter/db

#
# This option specifies the script directory to use.
#
# The installer program will set the default directory. If this default is
# subsequently commented out or removed, then the program will not run.
#
SCRIPTDIR=/usr/share/rkhunter/scripts

#
# This option can be used to modify the command directory list used by rkhunter
# to locate commands (that is, its PATH). By default this will be the root PATH,
# and an internal list of some common command directories.
#
# Any directories specified here will, by default, be appended to the default
# list. However, if a directory name begins with the '+' character, then that
# directory will be prepended to the list (that is, it will be put at the start
# of the list).
#
# This is a space-separated list of directory names. The option may be
# specified more than once.
#
# The default value is based on the root account PATH environment variable.
#
#BINDIR=/bin /usr/bin /sbin /usr/sbin
#BINDIR=+/usr/local/bin +/usr/local/sbin

#
# This option is a space-separated list of the languages that are to be updated
# when the '--update' option is used. If unset, then all the languages will be
# updated. If none of the languages are to be updated, then set this option to
# just 'en'.
#
# The default language, specified by the LANGUAGE option, and the English (en)
# language file will always be updated regardless of this option.
#
# This option may be specified more than once.
#
# The default value is the null string, indicating that all the language files
# will be updated.
#
UPDATE_LANG="en"

#
# This option specifies the log file pathname. The file will be created if it
# does not initially exist. If the option is unset, then the program will
# display a message each time it is run saying that the default value is being
# used.
#
# The default value is '/var/log/rkhunter.log'.
#
LOGFILE=/var/log/rkhunter.log

#
# Set the following option to enable the rkhunter check start and finish times
# to be logged by syslog. Warning messages will also be logged. The value of
# the option must be a standard syslog facility and priority, separated by a
# dot.  For example:
#
#     USE_SYSLOG=authpriv.warning
#
# Setting the value to 'NONE', or just leaving the option commented out,
# disables the use of syslog.
#
# The default value is not to use syslog.
#
USE_SYSLOG=authpriv.warning

#
# Set the following option to '0' if rkhunter should not detect if X is being
# used. If X is detected as being used, then the second colour set will
# automatically be used. If set to '1', then the use of X will be detected.
#
# The default value is '0'.
#
AUTO_X_DETECT=1

#
# Set this option to '1' to allow the use of the SSH-1 protocol, but note
# that theoretically it is weaker, and therefore less secure, than the
# SSH-2 protocol. Do not modify this option unless you have good reasons
# to use the SSH-1 protocol (for instance for AFS token passing or Kerberos4
# authentication). If the 'Protocol' option has not been set in the SSH
# configuration file, then a value of '2' may be set here in order to
# suppress a warning message. A value of '0' indicates that the use of
# SSH-1 is not allowed.
#
# The default value is '0'.
#
ALLOW_SSH_PROT_V1=2

#
# These two options determine which tests are to be performed. The ENABLE_TESTS
# option can use the word 'ALL' to refer to all of the available tests. The
# DISABLE_TESTS option can use the word 'NONE' to mean that no tests are
# disabled. The list of disabled tests is applied to the list of enabled tests.
#
# Both options are space-separated lists of test names, and both options may
# be specified more than once. The currently available test names can be seen
# by using the command 'rkhunter --list tests'.
#
# The supplied configuration file has some tests already disabled, and these
# are tests that will be used only occasionally, can be considered 'advanced'
# or that are prone to produce more than the average number of false-positives.
#
# Please read the README file for more details about enabling and disabling
# tests, the test names, and how rkhunter behaves when these options are used.
#
# The default values are to enable all tests and to disable none. However, if
# either of the options below are specified, then they will override the
# program defaults.
#
ENABLE_TESTS=ALL
DISABLE_TESTS=suspscan hidden_ports hidden_procs deleted_files packet_cap_apps apps

#
# This option whitelists files and directories from existing, or not existing,
# on the system at the time of testing. This option is used when the
# configuration file options themselves are checked, and during the file
# properties check, the hidden files and directories checks, and the filesystem
# check of the '/dev' directory.
#
# This option may be specified more than once, and may use wildcards.
# Be aware though that this is probably not what you want to do as the
# wildcarding will be expanded after files have been deleted. As such
# deleted files won't be whitelisted if wildcarded.
#
# NOTE: The user must take into consideration how often the file will appear
# and disappear from the system in relation to how often rkhunter is run. If
# the file appears, and disappears, too often then rkhunter may not notice
# this. All it will see is that the file has changed. The inode number and DTM
# will certainly be different for each new file, and rkhunter will report this.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#EXISTWHITELIST=""

#
# Whitelist various attributes of the specified file. The attributes are those
# of the 'attributes' test. Specifying a file name here does not include it
# being whitelisted for the write permission test (see below).
#
# This option may be specified more than once, and may use wildcard characters.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#ATTRWHITELIST=/usr/bin/date

#
# Allow the specified file to have the 'others' (world) permission have the
# write-bit set. For example, files with permissions r-xr-xrwx or rwxrwxrwx.
#
# This option may be specified more than once, and may use wildcard characters.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#WRITEWHITELIST=/usr/bin/date

#
# Allow the specified file to be a script.
#
# This option may be specified more than once, and may use wildcard characters.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
SCRIPTWHITELIST=/usr/bin/egrep

#SCRIPTWHITELIST=/usr/sbin/unhide.rb

#
# Allow the specified hidden directory to be whitelisted.
#
# This option may be specified more than once, and may use wildcard characters.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#ALLOWHIDDENDIR=/etc/.java
#ALLOWHIDDENDIR=/etc/.git
#ALLOWHIDDENDIR=/dev/.lxc

#
# Allow the specified hidden file to be whitelisted.

#
# This option allows the specified applications, or a specific version of an
# application, to be whitelisted. If a specific version is to be whitelisted,
# then the name must be followed by a colon and then the version number.
# For example:
#
#     APP_WHITELIST=openssl:0.9.7d gpg httpd:1.3.29
#
# This is a space-separated list of pathnames. The option may be specified
# more than once.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#APP_WHITELIST=""

#
# This option may be used to whitelist file pathnames from the suspscan test.
#
# Shell globbing may be used in the pathname. Also see the GLOBSTAR configuration
# option.
#
# This option may be specified more than once.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#SUSPSCAN_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following options can be used to whitelist network ports which are known
# to have been used by malware. 
#
# The PORT_WHITELIST option is a space-separated list of one or more of two
# types of whitelisting. These are:
#
#   1) a 'protocol:port' pair
#   2) an asterisk ('*')
#
# Only the UDP or TCP protocol may be specified, and the port number must be
# between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
#
# The asterisk can be used to indicate that any executable which rkhunter can
# locate as a command, is whitelisted. (Also see BINDIR)
#
# The PORT_PATH_WHITELIST option specifies one of two types of whitelisting.
# These are:
#
#   1) a pathname to an executable
#   2) a combined pathname, protocol and port
#
# As above, the protocol can only be TCP or UDP, and the port number must be
# between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
#
# Examples:
#
#     PORT_WHITELIST=TCP:2001 UDP:32011
#     PORT_PATH_WHITELIST=/usr/sbin/squid
#     PORT_PATH_WHITELIST=/usr/sbin/squid:TCP:3801
#
# NOTE: In order to whitelist a pathname, or use the asterisk option, the
# 'lsof' command must be present.
#
# Both options may be specified more than once.
#
# The default value for both options is the null string.
#
#PORT_WHITELIST=""
#PORT_PATH_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following two options can be used to whitelist files and directories that
# would normally be flagged with a warning during the various rootkit and
# malware checks. Only existing files and directories can be specified, and
# these must be full pathnames not links.
#
# Additionally, the RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST option may include a string after the
# file name (separated by a colon). This will then only whitelist that string
# in that file (as part of the malware checks). For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local:hdparm
#
# If the option list includes the filename on its own as well, then the file
# will be whitelisted from rootkit checks of the files existence, but still
# only the specific string within the file will be whitelisted. For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local:hdparm
#
# To whitelist a file from the existence checks, but not from the strings
# checks, then include the filename on its own and on its own but with just
# a colon appended. For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local:
#
# NOTE: It is recommended that if you whitelist any files, then you include
# those files in the file properties check. See the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS
# configuration option.
#
# Both of these options may be specified more than once.
#
# For both options the default value is the null string.
#
#RTKT_DIR_WHITELIST=""
#RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following option can be used to whitelist shared library files that would
# normally be flagged with a warning during the preloaded shared library check.
# These library pathnames usually exist in the '/etc/ld.so.preload' file or in
# the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
#
# NOTE: It is recommended that if you whitelist any files, then you include
# those files in the file properties check. See the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS
# configuration option.
#
# This option is a space-separated list of library pathnames. The option may be
# specified more than once.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#SHARED_LIB_WHITELIST=/lib/snoopy.so

#
# The following option can be set to a command which rkhunter will use when
# downloading files from the Internet - that is, when the '--update' or
# '--versioncheck' option is used. The command can take options.
#
# This allows the user to use a command other than the one automatically
# selected by rkhunter, but still one which it already knows about.
# For example:
#
#     WEB_CMD=curl
#
# Alternatively, the user may specify a completely new command. However, note
# that rkhunter expects the downloaded file to be written to stdout, and that
# everything written to stderr is ignored. For example:
#
#     WEB_CMD="/opt/bin/dlfile --timeout 5m -q"
#
# *BSD users may want to use the 'ftp' command, provided that it supports the
# HTTP protocol:
#
#     WEB_CMD="ftp -o -"
#
# This option has no default value.
#
WEB_CMD="/bin/false"

#
# This option can be set to either '0' or '1'. If set to '1' then the globbing
# characters '**' can be used to allow the recursive checking of directories.
# This can be useful, for example, with the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS option.
# For example:
#
#	USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS=/etc/**/*.conf
#
# This will check all '.conf' files within the '/etc' directory, and any
# sub-directories (at any level). If GLOBSTAR is not set, then the shell will
# interpret '**' as '*' and only one level of sub-directories will be checked.
#
# NOTE: This option is only valid for those shells which support the 'globstar'
# option. Typically this will be 'bash' (version 4 and above) via the 'shopt' command,
# and 'ksh' via the 'set' command.
#
# The default value is '0'.
#
#GLOBSTAR=0
