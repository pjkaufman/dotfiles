# Themes

Catppuccin and other themes can be placed here.

## Select a Theme:

1. Set gnome theme via `gnome tweaks` and then setting the theme to the desired theme
2. Update the GTK theme export: `export GTK_THEME='THEME_NAME'`
3. *Run `sudo flatpak override --filesystem="$HOME/.themes"`
4. *Run `sudo flatpak override --env=GTK_THEME="$GTK_THEME"`

*: These two steps can be replaced by re-running the install script
