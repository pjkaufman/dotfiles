# Sigil

Sigil is an Epub reader/editor. It is great for helping looking at ebook content and getting formatted properly when
a change needs to be done manually or otherwise.

There are a couple things that are saved from Sigil to save time:
- The dictionaries used to validate what words are valid words
  - helps find spelling mistakes faster when the list is properly filled out
  - Note that these need to be manually enabled by editing preferences on initial use under preferences
- Styles
  - Currently there is a file called `qt_styles.qss.bak` that is meant to go ahead and serve as a backup if I want a dark theme for Sigil that is not supplied by Kvantum
