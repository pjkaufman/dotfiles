## Features to Add

- Show Info should display light novels releasing this month in yellow, and last month or earlier in red
- Get-info should be able to determine if the latest release for a series already came out and handle that accordingly
- Add more unit tests and validation for commands and parsing logic to make sure it works as intended and is easier to refactor down the road since breaking changes should be easier to catch
