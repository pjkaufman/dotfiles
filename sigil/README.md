# Sigil

Sigil is an Epub reader/editor. It is great for helping looking at ebook content and getting formatted properly when
a change needs to be done manually or otherwise.

There are a couple things that are saved from Sigil to save time:
- The dictionaries used to validate what words are valid words
  - helps find spelling mistakes faster when the list is properly filled out
- Styles
  - This just helps keep things look the way I want without having to spend a lot of time looking for things
