# VsCode

VsCode is a text editor that is pretty extensible and easy to use. It hides a lot of setup details from the user which can make understanding things at a more in depth level harder.
However that allows for the user to focus more on dev work. It is a trade off.

The following pieces of data are stored here for VsCode:
- Keymap settings
- User settings
- Extension info
