# Bigger Than All My Problems

\~ 1 \~ Bigger than all the shadows that fall across my path  
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see;  
Bigger than my confusion, bigger than anything,  
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see.

Bigger than all my problems, bigger than all my fears;  
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see;  
Bigger than all my questions, bigger than anything,  
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see.

\~ 2 \~ Bigger than all the giants of fear and unbelief,  
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see;  
Bigger than all my hang-ups, bigger than anything,  
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see.

Fill my soul with Thy Spirit, Fill my heart with Thy love;

# A Glorious Church

\~ 1 \~ Do you hear them coming, Brother, Thronging up the steeps of light,  
Clad in glorious shining garments Blood-washed garments pure and white?

CHORUS:  
\'Tis a glorious Church without spot or wrinkle, Washed in the blood of the Lamb.  
\'Tis a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle, Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

\~ 2 \~ Do you hear the stirring anthems Filling all the earth and sky?  
\'Tis a grand victorious army. Lift its banner up on high!

\~ 3 \~ Never fear the clouds of sorrow; Never fear the storms of sin.  
Even now our joys begin.

\~ 4 \~ Wave the banner, shout His praises, For our victory is nigh!  
We shall join our conquering Savior. We shall reign with Him on high.
