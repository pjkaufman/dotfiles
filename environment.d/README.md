# Environment Variables for Systemd

This is a place where environment variables for systemd programs can be set. As of right now I just use this for Sway.
However I may need to add other values here.

The reason I needed to add values for Sway was to allow the clipboard manager to be found and to allow for xdg variables to get set for use at that level.
